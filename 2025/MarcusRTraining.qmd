## Description

The Marcus R Training program was developed by Hasse Walum of Emory University. The program will cover the following:

1. Importing data 
2. Basic data visualization 
3. Exporting and saving plots
4. Data transformation
5. R Markdown basics
6. Summarizing data
7. String manipulation and data joining

Rather than reinventing what is covered in the Marcus R Training program, we have been granted permission to use the materials for our SATVI Computational Course. 

Over the next 6 weeks, we will refer to the Marcus R Training materials for our sessions.
