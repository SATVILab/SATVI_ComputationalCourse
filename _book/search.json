Once a package is installed, you do not have to re-install when you open a new R session. Simply load the package from the library. For example, if I want to use ggplot2 and I have installed it before, load the package using &gt;library(ggplot2). However, if you are running your script on a different machine that does not have the package installed (and are not working from a container - we'll get to this later in the course), you will need to install the package on that machine before loading it from the library.",

    "text": "5.4 FAQ\n\n5.4.0.1 Session 1\nQ1: What are the best ways to set your working directory?\nA: There are a few ways to do this:\n\n    1. If you are using Mac, you can navigate to the directory you would like to work in using Finder. Right click the directory and hold down the \"option\" key. You will see an option pop up that reads \"Copy path/to/directory as Pathname\". Select this option to copy the pathname, then paste it into R using setwd(). This option is generally recommended. \n\n    2. You can also set the working directory using point and click in RStudio. To do so, navigte to the \"Session\" tab in RStudio, then to \"Set Working Directory\". Follow the options to set the working directory as desired. \n\n    3. A note about setting working directories in scripts. It is good practice to avoid using absolute file paths in your scripts, including setwd(). This means if you have your data on your PC under the filepath \"User/Documents/ProjectA/analysis/data\", for example, as much as possible, avoid writing this complete path into your code. This becomes problematic if you ever need to run your code on a different machine or HPC, or if a collaborator needs to run your code and has a different file structure. R will not be able to find your data if it is not stored in exactly the same place on every machine. A better option is to set your working directory using the R console (do not setwd() in the saved script). In the console, set your working directory to whatever folder contains your generic subdirectories (i.e. \"data\", \"output\"), in this example, the \"analysis\" folder. Then when you run your script, all you need to include when you specify a filepath is \"data\" or \"output\". So, if you ever run the script on a different machine, the user can store the relevant files anywhere they want, as long as they have subdirectories \"data\" and \"output\". \nQ2: When generating a plot using ggplot2, does the name used in the script for the row or column we want to plot have to match the col or rowname of the associated dataframe exactly?\nA: Yes. The names must match exactly because R searches the dataframe for col or rownames as you specify them. If you have a typo or a lower vs uppercase, it won't find that row or column in the dataframe. Also be aware of any col or rownames that include spaces. Spaces in col and rownames can confuse R into thinking you are indicating more than one name. To avoid this, if you need to specify a col or rowname that includes a space, you must place single back ticks around the full name to indicate to R that this is one complete col or rowname. For example, if you have a column called Sample Name, you must write it into your script as 'Sample Name' for ggplot2 to work properly. \nQ3: What is the difference between facet_wrap() and facet_grid()?\nA: Both are options that can be applied to ggplot2. facet_wrap() wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. It is best used if you want to display data in a rectangular arrangement. It is used when you want to plot one variable. facet_grid() will create a panel matrix defined by numbers of rows and columns. It is ideal for plotting multiple variables that should be visualized separately for the same data. For example, if you want to plot time vs. weight, and time vs. height, you can use facet_grid() to plot both comparisons in a grid layout. Including a ~ either before or after each variable will change the orientation of variables plotted in the grid (i.e. the variable placed before the ~ will be plotted on the row, the variable placed after the ~ will be plotted on the column).\nQ4: When should I specify aes globally vs. locally?\nA: In general, specify aes in mapping (global) so that the specifications are applied to all of the data. If you need something more fine-tuned, you can write it into geom_point (lobal), where it will be applied only to that geom_point. \nQ5: What are HEX codes?\nA: HEX codes are unique alphanumeric codes assigned to specific colors. They can be used to assign specific colors to your data points when you plot in R. There are also pre-defined color schemes (i.e. printer-friendly, colorblind safe) that you can select. To find more information on HEX codes or colorshemes, visit [https://colorbrewer2.org](https://colorbrewer2.org)\nQ6: What are your recommendations for using Chat GPT for help with coding?\nA: Chat GPT is a quickly growing tool used by coders. It can be very helpful for designing / troubleshooting code. We recommend using Chat GPT when you are stuck before spending hours sifting through other online sites. Information given by Chat GPT can and should be verified with the original sources. We caution against allowing Chat GPT to do your work for you! It is best to become proficient and understand coding languages independently and using Chat GPT as an assistant. Relying on it entirely will ultimately be to your detriment. When you do use Chat GPT, read the descriptions and explanations it gives and make you understand thoroughly so you can use it yourself next time. If you do need help in a hurry, you can ask Chat GPT to keep responses brief by typing \"No yapping.\" Always say please and thank you to Chat GPT for offering such superb assistance!\n\n\n5.4.0.2 Session 2\nQ1: What is the difference between top and bottom windows in R Studio?\nA: It can help to think of this an analogy: In R Studio, the top left (script) is your recipe, bottom left (console) is your kitchen, top right (environment) is your pantry. The script window shows your saved scripts that you can use each time you need to run the analysis. You can make edits and save just like you might for your favourite recipe. The console is where you do the work. As you run lines of your script, you will see that in the console below, each line is copied into the console and run in real time. Here you can see the script running and any warnings and outputs. The environment, like a pantry, is where all of the necessary \"ingredients\" to run your script are kept. Just as you would before you start cooking, as you go through your script, you will load necessary items (i.e. data / metadata) into your environment so that when the recipe calls for it, it is there and ready to go. The final bottom right window serves a few functions. It can show file paths, plot outputs, packages etc. We encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with each window to better understand their functionalities. Happy cooking! I mean coding. \nQ2: Can you plot confidence intervals automatically using geom_errorbar or do you have to calculate them separately first?\nA: Confidence intervals should be calculated separately. \n\n\n5.4.0.3 Session 3\nQ1: How can you save the contents of the R console when I finish a session?\nA1: You can save the contents of the base R console using the 'sink()' function. Here you will specify the file path where you want the file to be saved. sink() will then save the console contents as a .txt file in your specified directory. sink must sandwich your code that you want to save.\n\nFor example: \n\nsink(\"output/console_content.txt\")\n\nRun code of your choice\n\nsink()\n\nA2: If using RStudio, you can do this via point and click. Navigate to \"History\" in the top right window. Click \"Save\". You must do this before ending the session. The \"Save\" option that comes up upon closing the session will save a hidden . Rdata file, not your console output as a separate file. \nQ2: How does ‘filter()’ work?\nA: The 'filter()' function from the 'dplyr' package is used to subset data frames based on specified conditions. Specify the data frame and condition as follows:\n\nfilter(.data, condition)\n\nHere .data is any data frame in your environment that you want to filter. Condition needs to be specified to filter the data frame however you need. filter() will search through each column (or a specified column) until it finds a row that meets the specified condition. Any row that has a value that meets your condition will be removed. Typically when we filter we assign the filtered data frame to a new name, or overwrite the original data frame. For example:\n\nfiltered.data &lt;- filter(original.data, original.data$frequency &gt; 0.05)\n\nfiltered.data have rows with frequency &gt; 0.05 removed. \nQ3: What is the difference between a function and an operator?\nA: A function is a chunk of code that is designed to perform a specific task. They typically wrap multiple arguments and use complex logic that is inefficient to rewrite each time it is needed. A function streamlines the process so all you have to do is call the function, specify a small number of options. This is typically done in one line of code. \n\nAlternatively, an operator is a simple symbol that is used to perform arithmetic, logical, or rational operations on data. For example a '+' is an arithmetic operator for addition. \nQ4: Why does the ‘is.na()’ function work if the NA in my data frame is uppercase? Isn’t it case-specific?\nA: Though most things in R are case specific, is.na() isn't actually looking for the specific \"NA\" text. NA comes up as an empty or missing value. Therefore, even though we see NA as uppercase, in R it comes up as a missing value, so the case of the text doesn't matter. Where is.na() finds a missing value, it will return a value of 'TRUE'. Actual values will be returned as 'FALSE'",

We will be using the built-in “iris” and “mtcars” datasets available in R. We encourage you to go through these steps with a dataset of your own and export formats that are relevant to your study. This session will cover commonly needed formats, including .xlsx, .csv, .pdf, .png, and .jpeg. However, there are many additional data formats that can be used and we recommend exploring these independently. Keep in mind that there are many different ways to do similar things in R, i.e. multiple packages to export to .xlsx. This script is intended to provide some helpful examples, but is not comprehensive.",

If you have data for your own study, we suggest writing a simple script that is relevant to the analyses you will need to do. The only requirements are that you should use data that can be imported / exported in a table or dataframe format and plotted. If you do not have data of your own yet, you can use a built in dataset available from R. To find built in datasets use the following command:\ndata()\nNow perform the following steps:\n\nClear your environment.\nSet your working directory. This should be in a location where you perform work related to this course.\nSet output directory. This should be a subdirectory within your working directory where you want to save any files that you generate. You can create this manually in your normal file finder or create it using R as is done in the script above.\nLoad libraries that are necessary for your script.\nLoad your dataset. Either import your own data or load one of the built in datasets.\nExamine data structure.\nPlot your data however you like! Refer to previous sessions for ideas and guidance.\nSave your plots as pdf, png, and jpeg.\nExport your data file as .xlsx and .csv. Confirm that your row and colnames are in the correct position.\nSave a relevant object from your environment as .Rdata and .rds.\nLoad your .Rdata and .rds files back into R.\nConsult the internet or ChatGPT and find at least one alternative method to import, export, and save your data or plots.

    "section": "",
    "text": "7.1.1 What is Git?\nGit is the most widely used version control system to date. It is free and open source. Git-based version controlling allows users to track changes that have been made to documents, code, etc. It also gives users the ability to restore version-controlled documents to earlier versions and collaborate with other developers.\nSome common vocabulary:\n1. Directory = Folder\n2. Repository = Parent folder which is the top folder for your project\n3. Commit = a \"saved\" snapshot of the repository or files within it \n4. Push = upload the current version of your repository to GitHub\n5. Pull = download content from a remote GitHub repository and update the local repository to the pulled version \n6. Clone = copy a remote GitHub repository to a local location \n7. Staging area = contains information about what you will include in your next commit\n8. Terminal = a.k.a. command line, interface for text commands\n9. CLI = command line interface, allows certain programs to interface with the command line (for example, quarto has a CLI that allows you to run quarto commands from the terminal in RStudio)\nWhat is the difference between Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop?\nGit is the tool that actually tracks changes made to your code over time and allows for version control. GitHub is an online website that stores your Git repositories. GitHub Desktop is a downloaded software that allows you to work with your Git repositories locally.\n\n\n7.1.2 Basic git commands:\n1. git clone = copy a GitHub repository to your local machine\n2. git add = add files to the git staging area\n3. git commit = save files (typically with a message describing what was changed)\n4. git push = upload files in the commit to a remote repository (GitHub)\n5. git pull = download remote repository to local directory and update local repository with remote version \n\n\n7.1.3 Interface with git from your local machine using the Terminal\nMost of the time, we use git on our local machine to develop the contents of the repo and then push them to GitHub. For this session, we will be interfacing with git from the Terminal to build an understanding of how git operates on a fundamental level. In our next session, we will cover how to develop git-controlled projects using the code editor VS Code.\n1. Confirm git is installed. Open Terminal and type the following:\nNote - If you can’t find your Terminal, (for Mac) you can press Cmd + space to open Spotlight search. Type “Termianl”. We recommend adding Terminal to your dock.\n\ngit --version\n\nYou should see a readout that looks like this:\n\n2. Configure git\n\nThis will allow you to set your user information so it will stay consistent across all git commits and repositories. You will only need to do this once. \n\n# To set the name attached to your commits\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n\n# To set the email attached to your commits\ngit config --global user.email \"youremail@email.com\"\n\n3. Navigate to your local working directory where you would like to store your git repository.\n\ncd /PATH/TO/WORKING/DIRECTORY\n\n4. Make a directory for your project and initialize git. \n\nmkdir [PROJECT NAME]\n\ncd [PROJECT NAME]\n\ngit init\n\n5. Create your files locally. \n\n      - You can populate the repo with any files that you like. Be it a Quarto project, a simple R script, or a data folder. \n\n      - You should always have .gitignore and README.md files in your repository. .gitignore should be added before anything else because if you begin adding and committing files before you specify which should be ignored, they will already be tracked. \n      \nNote - You do not need to do this manually if creating a Quarto Project as these files are already included\nNote - the .gitignore file will be automatically hidden in your file finder. If you want to find and edit your .gitignore, on a Mac, you can use the keyboard shortcut Cmd + shift + . to view it or open the repo in a code editor (this will be covered later).\n\n# To create a .gitignore from the Terminal\n\ntouch .gitignore\n\n\n# To create a README.md from the Terminal\n\ntouch README.md\n\nIt is generally good practice to now set up a basic repo structure. First edit the .gitignore to ignore any large folders or files that you do not want to track (for large analyses, consider ignorming data and output folders)\nMake a directory for data. This should generally contain raw unprocessed data.\n\nmkdir data\n\nMake a directory for output. This should generally contain any of the processed outputs (processed data, figs, etc) generated by your code.\n\nmkdir output\n\n6. Check the status of your repo. \n\ngit status\n\n7. Add your new or edited files to the staging area. \n\n      - The git staging area is an intermediate platform between working files and permanently stored version-controlled commits. This allows you to continue working with any files and confirm they are correct before committing. Any files added to the staging area will be committed in the next commit. \n\n# To add one file \ngit add file.txt\n\n# To add multiple files\ngit add file.txt file2.csv\n\n# To add files by pattern\ngit add *.text\n\n# To add all files in the directory recursively \ngit add .\n\nNote - Be careful when adding all files recursively, because it will also add large files if they are not specified in .gitignore\nCheck status again to confirm correct files have been added to the staging area.\n\ngit status\n\n8. View unstaged changes. \n\n      - It is good practice to view the changes that have been made before committing. Normally we do this in a visual code editor (i.e. VS Code), but for now we will go over how to do this from the Terminal. \n\n# To see staged changes\ngit diff --staged\n\n# To exit, press \"q\"\n\n#To see unstaged changes\ngit diff\n\n9. If necessary, unstage files. \n\n      - If you view your changes and notice an error (i.e. you have staged a large file that you don't want to track), you can remove it from the staging area or \"unstage\" it before you commit. \n\n# To unstage a specific file\ngit restore --staged file.txt\n\n# or\ngit rm --cached file.txt\n\n# To unstage multiple files \ngit restore -- staged file.txt file2.csv\n\n# To unstage files by pattern\ngit restore --staged *.txt\n\n# To unstage everything in the staging area while maintinging changes the files\ngit reset .\n\n10. Commit changes\n\n      - Once you are happy with the files in your staging area you can commit to save the changes and the current snapshot of the repository. \n\n*Note - It is good practice to always include a short \"message\" with each commit that describes what was changed. This should be written in present tense. Your first commit is generally called \"Initial commit.\"*\n\n# The -m option will include the message for your commit\n\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit.\"\n\n11. Push repo to GitHub.\nTo update the online remote repository, you need to push the repo to GitHub. An easy way to do this is to use the GitHub CLI. If you have not done so already, download and install.\n\n# To push using GitHub CLI, authenticate GitHub\ngh auth login\n\n# Follow the prompts in the Terminal\n\n# Create a remote repository\ngh repo create\n\n# To push the repository we created here, you must select \"Push an existing local repository to GitHub\". You can also use gh repo create to create a new repository from scratch or from a template. To push the existing local repo, paste the file path at the prompt\n\n?Path to local repository (.) /PATH/TO/LOCAL/REPO\n\nNote - If you already have a remote repository created that is cloned to a local directory, after making changes locally, you can push the local repository to the remote repository using the following:\n\ngit push\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Branching and Merging from the Terminal\nOne main feature of git repositories is the ability to create and merge different branches. This comes in handy when you have multiple people working on the same project. You can work on different branches that are dedicated to different parts of the project, and then those branches can be merged back into the master branch.\n1. Create and switch to a branch\n\n# To create a new branch called \"dev\"\ngit branch dev\n\n# To begin working in the \"dev\" branch\ngit checkout dev\n\n# Alternatively, do do this in one step\ngit checkout -b dev\n\nNow you can make your changes and commit on that branch.\n2. Merge the branch back into the master branch. \n\ngit merge dev\n\n3. Now return to the main branch\n\ngit checkout master\n\n# Or\ngit checkout main\n\n\n\n7.1.5 Using git commands to navigate through git architecture from the Terminal\nThis diagram from unstop may be helpful for understanding how git commands can be used to move files around between local and remote directories. The webpage also gives a thorough description of how git and GitHub work.\n\n\n\nhttps://unstop.com/blog/what-is-git\n\n\n\n\n7.1.6 Create, branch, and clone a repository from GitHub\nThink of a git repository as a project folder. All of the documents that you will need to run analyses for your project should be stored within the same repo.\n1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com/login).\n\n2. From your homepage, click the \"New\" button to create a new repository.\n\n3. Give the repo a name and description and adjust settings if necessary. \n\n          - We typically set the repo to private until it is ready to share publicly. \n\n          - You can add README.md and .gitignore files here if you like, or you can add them later. If you are creating a project locally, it often makes more sense to create these files locally. For some projects, for example, a Quarto Project, these files are already included in the Quarto Project architecture, so you do not need to create them here. \n\n4. If necessary, add README.md on GitHub. \n\n        - All projects MUST have a README file. This is a Markdown file that should contain all relevant information to describe the repository and instructions for running any analyses. \n\n\n5. Create a new branch. \n\n6. Clone your remote repo to your working directory. \n\n      - There are a number of ways to do this. To clone the repo from the command line, go to the online repo on GitHub, click \"Code\" and select your method. Copy the path and replace it into the line of code shown below in the Terminal: \n\ngit clone https://github.com/SATVILab/SATVI_ComputationalCourse.git\n\n\n\n7.1.7 Create, branch, and push a repository from GitHub Desktop\n1. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in.\n\n2. Add a repository. This repo can either be cloned from GitHub, created as a new repo, or added from an existing local repo. \n\n3. Branch the repo. \n\n4. Push the repo to GitHub.",

Here’s the answer it gave me.\nBut typically it is a bit quicker to just look what is in the object and extract it. When you get complicated output like when printing the cor_test_obj_spearman object, you can use the following code to see what is in the object:\n\n\nCode\ncorr_test_obj_spearman |&gt; attributes()\n\n\n$names\n[1] \"statistic\"   \"parameter\"   \"p.value\"     \"estimate\"    \"null.value\" \n[6] \"alternative\" \"method\"      \"data.name\"  \n\n$class\n[1] \"htest\"\n\n\nIf we are not sure what these names mean exactly, typically they are listed in the help file of the function:\n\n\nCode\n?cor.test\n\n\nThey’re under the Value header (would need to scroll down a bit, comes right before examples):\n\nCode\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/inference/help_file.png\")\n\n\n\ncorr_tbl_spearman &lt;- data.frame(\n  `est` = cor_test_obj_spearman$estimate,\n  `p_val` = cor_test_obj_spearman$p.value\n)\ncorr_tbl_spearman\n\n           est     p_val\nrho -0.1909091 0.4053961\n\n\nThis is not an attractive table. We can make it more presentable with the following code:\n\nCode\ncorr_tbl_spearman &lt;- corr_tbl_spearman |&gt;\n  # show only significant digits\n  mutate(\n    Correlation = est |&gt; signif(3),\n    `P-value` = p_val |&gt; signif(3)\n  ) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(-c(est, p_val))\n# don't display the row names\nrownames(corr_tbl_spearman) &lt;- NULL\n# display using `kable` function:\ncorr_tbl_spearman |&gt; kable()\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation\nP-value\n\n\n\n\n-0.191\n0.405\n\n\n\nNote that for the kable function to produce good output, you need to have the chunk option results: asis set.\n\n\n8.6.3 Alternatives\nWe’ll talk about the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Concordance correlation coefficient next week.",
