Many software packages and analysis pipelines depend on R. R is also a computational environment used for computing and generating graphics. \n\nTo install R for Windows or Mac, follow the instructions provided by The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) found here: https://cran.r-project.org/\n\nIt is recommended to download the precompiled binary distribution appropriate for your machine. \n\nTo learn more about R, read the following introduction provided by CRAN: https://www.r-project.org/about.html\n\n## R Studio\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) based on R. It provides a user-friendly option for building code and can incorporate multiple languages including python, which is also commonly used by computational immunologists. \n\nTo donwload and install RStudio Desktop, follow this link and the provided instructions: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"installations.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","book":{"title":"SATVI Computational Course","subtitle":"Session Guide","author":"SATVI Computational Group","date":"05 MAR 2024","downloads":"pdf","navbar":{"search":true,"background":"light"},"sidebar":{"border":true,"logo":"satvi_logo.png"},"chapters":["index.qmd","intro.qmd","installations.qmd","swirl.qmd","MarcusRTraining.qmd","summary.qmd","references.qmd"]},"bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","title":"Installations"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
